# Goblin Movie Recommender
The head of the regional board of goblins (Jeny), expressed that in a national poll of goblins 100% of goblins felt that their Goblinflix recommendations were innacurrate.

For any goblins here today who need a translator know that we have none and have no intentions of getting one after the last Goblin translator ate our cat. Please do not eat any Cats during todays presentation.
